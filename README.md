# Odin Recipes

This is my first project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).  
The goal of this project is to practice the basics of **HTML** by building a simple recipe website.  
The site will include a main index page with links to a few recipes, each recipe page containing ingredients and steps.

- Creating and editing a README file in Markdown  
- Practicing version control with Git (clone, commit, push)  
- Writing semantic HTML for a basic website structure  
- Organizing project files and directories

## Reflection
Once completed, this project will demonstrate my ability to:
- Use Git effectively to manage code history  
- Publish and maintain projects on GitHub  
- Build and link multiple HTML pages together
